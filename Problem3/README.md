This was simpler than I initially thought. My initial approach was to use a range of numbers to see whether the number would be divided without a remainder, and indeed it did work with small- to mid-size numbers. But with large numbers such as the one given in the assignment would run on and on without actually completing, even after 10 minutes. 

So I took a simpler approach where I used the smallest prime number to try to divide the number completely, if not, the prime number would increase by one. And it would go on. This was a lot faster and worked with the example number as well!
