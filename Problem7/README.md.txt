## Problem 5

### 10001st prime

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?

A pretty straightforward solution, but I think I improved the way I am dealing with these conditional statements using a while loop with a boolean called "isPrime" in this one. I saw this sort of method while I was studying sorting algorthims and it is quite simple to write. 

I also used a vector to store the prime numbers, but I deleted them after pushing them into the vector with the help of a counter I made, as I did not want to cluster the vector with the numbers that were not part of the problem.
